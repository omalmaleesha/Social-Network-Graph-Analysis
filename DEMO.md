# üéÆ Social Network Graph Analysis - Demo Guide

This guide shows you how to explore both the console application and the new web UI.

## üñ•Ô∏è Console Application Demo

The original console application demonstrates all the core algorithms:

### Sample Network
```
Alice ‚Üê‚Üí Bob (weight: 5)
Alice ‚Üê‚Üí Charlie (weight: 3)
Bob ‚Üê‚Üí David (weight: 2)
Charlie ‚Üê‚Üí David (weight: 4)
David ‚Üê‚Üí Eve (weight: 1)

Frank ‚Üê‚Üí Grace (weight: 2)
Grace ‚Üê‚Üí Heidi (weight: 3)
```

### Expected Output
```
Mutual Friends (Alice & Bob): [Charlie, David]
Friend Suggestions for Alice: [Eve]
Shortest Path Alice -> Eve: [Alice, Bob, David, Eve]
Strongest Path Alice -> Eve: [Alice, Bob, David, Eve]
Weakest Path Alice -> Eve: [Alice, Charlie, David, Eve]
Number of Communities: 2
Communities: {David=[Alice, Bob, Charlie, David, Eve], Grace=[Frank, Grace, Heidi]}

--- Centrality Measures ---
Degree Centrality of Alice: 2
Degree Centrality of David: 3
Most Connected User: David
Closeness Centrality of Alice: 0.5714285714285714
Closeness Centrality of David: 0.8333333333333334
User with Highest Closeness Centrality: David

--- PageRank Analysis ---
PageRank of Alice: 0.142857
PageRank of David: 0.238095
Most Influential User: David
```

## üåê Web UI Demo

The web interface provides the same functionality with visual interaction:

### 1. **Graph Visualization**
- Open `http://localhost:8080`
- See the network rendered as an interactive graph
- Drag nodes to rearrange the layout
- Zoom in/out with mouse wheel
- Click nodes to see detailed statistics

### 2. **Adding Users and Connections**
- Type a new username in the "Add User" field
- Select two users and set a weight to create friendships
- Watch the graph update in real-time

### 3. **Path Finding**
- Select two users from the path finding dropdowns
- Click "Shortest", "Strongest", or "Weakest" to find paths
- See the path highlighted on the graph with animation

### 4. **Community Analysis**
- Click "Highlight Communities" to see different groups in colors
- View the Communities tab to see detailed community information
- Each community shows member count and member list

### 5. **Friend Suggestions**
- Go to the Friend Suggestions tab
- Select a user to get AI-powered friend recommendations
- Add suggested friends with one click

### 6. **User Analytics**
- Click on any user node to see detailed statistics:
  - Degree Centrality
  - Closeness Centrality
  - PageRank Score
  - Clustering Coefficient
  - Friends List

### 7. **Network Statistics**
The sidebar shows real-time network metrics:
- Total Users and Connections
- Number of Communities
- Network Density
- Average Clustering Coefficient
- Top Users (Most Connected, Most Influential)

## üéØ Interactive Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Building a Social Network
1. Start with the sample data
2. Add yourself as a new user
3. Connect yourself to existing users
4. Watch how your addition affects network metrics
5. See if you become the most connected user

### Scenario 2: Community Formation
1. Add several new users
2. Create connections to form a new community
3. Observe how the community detection algorithm identifies your group
4. Try connecting communities to see how they merge

### Scenario 3: Influence Analysis
1. Create a "hub" user connected to many others
2. Compare PageRank scores before and after
3. Use the path finding to see how this affects network connectivity
4. Analyze the clustering coefficient changes

### Scenario 4: Friend Recommendation Testing
1. Create users with mutual friends
2. Test the friend suggestion algorithm
3. Add suggested friends and see how it affects the network
4. Compare different users' suggestion quality

## üîç Algorithm Exploration

### Shortest Path (BFS)
- **Use Case**: Finding the minimum number of hops between users
- **Try**: Find path from Alice to Eve
- **Observe**: The algorithm finds [Alice, Bob, David, Eve]

### Strongest Path (Modified Dijkstra)
- **Use Case**: Finding the path with highest friendship strengths
- **Try**: Compare strongest vs shortest paths
- **Observe**: May take different routes based on edge weights

### Community Detection (DSU)
- **Use Case**: Identifying friend groups
- **Try**: Add connections between communities
- **Observe**: How communities merge when connected

### PageRank Algorithm
- **Use Case**: Measuring user influence
- **Try**: Create a highly connected user
- **Observe**: How PageRank scores change

### Centrality Measures
- **Degree**: Number of direct connections
- **Closeness**: How close a user is to all others
- **Betweenness**: How often a user lies on paths between others

## üé® UI Features to Explore

### Theme Switching
- Click the moon/sun icon to toggle dark/light theme
- Notice how the graph colors adapt to the theme

### Responsive Design
- Resize your browser window
- See how the layout adapts to different screen sizes
- Try the interface on mobile devices

### Export Functionality
- Click the "Export" button to download network data
- The JSON file contains all users, connections, and statistics

### Real-time Updates
- All changes are immediately reflected in:
  - Graph visualization
  - Statistics panel
  - Community detection
  - User details

## üöÄ Performance Testing

### Large Network Simulation
1. Add 20+ users through the UI
2. Create random connections between them
3. Test path finding performance
4. Observe community formation patterns
5. Monitor how statistics change with network size

### Edge Cases
- Try finding paths between disconnected users
- Test with users who have no friends
- Create very dense networks (everyone connected to everyone)
- Test with networks that have bridges (single connections between communities)

## üìä Data Analysis Tips

### Network Density
- **Low density** (< 0.3): Sparse network with few connections
- **Medium density** (0.3-0.7): Balanced network
- **High density** (> 0.7): Very connected network

### Clustering Coefficient
- **High clustering**: Users' friends are also friends with each other
- **Low clustering**: More diverse, less cliquish network

### Community Structure
- **Many small communities**: Fragmented network
- **Few large communities**: Well-integrated network
- **Single community**: Fully connected network

Enjoy exploring the social network analysis with both the console and web interfaces! üéâ
