# üß† Social Network Graph Analysis (Java DSA Project)

This project is a **Social Network Graph Analysis** tool built in **Java** using **core Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**. It simulates a social media-like environment where users can connect, and the system analyzes friendships, suggests new friends, finds paths between users, detects communities, and measures user influence.

## üöÄ Features

- üë• Add Users and Friendships (with weights)
- üîÅ Mutual Friends Finder
- ü§ù Enhanced Friend Suggestion System (using Jaccard Similarity)
- üß≠ Shortest Path Between Two Users (BFS)
- üí™ Strongest and Weakest Path Finder (Dijkstra's Algorithm)
- üß© Community Detection (Disjoint Set Union)
- üìä Centrality Measures (Degree and Closeness Centrality)
- üåü PageRank for User Influence Ranking
- üëë Identification of Most Connected and Influential Users

## üìö Technologies & DSA Concepts Used

- Java (No external libraries)
- HashMap & HashSet (for Graph, User, and PageRank management)
- Adjacency List (for graph representation)
- Breadth-First Search (for shortest path)
- Dijkstra's Algorithm (for strongest/weakest paths)
- Disjoint Set Union (for community detection)
- Priority Queue (for path finding and centrality measures)
- Iterative Algorithms (for PageRank computation)
- Set Operations (for Jaccard Similarity in friend suggestions)
- Basic Object-Oriented Programming

## üß± Future Enhancements

- GUI or Web interface (JavaFX or Spring Boot) for interactive network visualization
- Add user profile data (e.g., interests, location)
- Real-time friend graph visualization using graph libraries
- Persistent storage using file or database
- Advanced centrality measures (e.g., Betweenness Centrality)
- Detection of bridges and articulation points in the network
