# 🧠 Social Network Graph Analysis (Java DSA Project)

This project is a simple **Social Network Graph Analysis** tool built in **Java** using **core Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**. It simulates a social media-like environment where users can connect, and the system can analyze friendships, suggest new friends, and find the shortest connection path between users.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 👥 Add Users and Friendships
- 🔁 Mutual Friends Finder
- 🤝 Friend Suggestion System
- 🧭 Shortest Path Between Two Users (BFS)
- 🧩 Optional: Disjoint Set Union (DSU) for detecting friend groups

---

## 📚 Technologies & DSA Concepts Used

- Java (No external libraries)
- HashMap & HashSet (for Graph & User management)
- Adjacency List (for graph representation)
- Breadth-First Search (for shortest path)
- Disjoint Set Union (for friend circles)
- Basic Object-Oriented Programming
